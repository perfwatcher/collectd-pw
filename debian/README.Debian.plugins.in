collectd-pw on Debian
=====================

collectd-pw is a patched version of collectd for PerfWatcher support.  The
comments below come from the Debian collectd package, but should still apply,
though perhaps with slightly different package names (eg: collectd-pw-core vs.
collectd-core).  In large part all paths have remained the same, except for
possibly /usr/share/doc paths, which should have symlinks to the -pw paths from
the usual paths.


collectd plugins on Debian
==========================

Some plugins require additional libraries. To prevent you from having to
install dozens of further packages that you don't actually need, there is no
strict dependency on those libraries. Rather, they are listed as recommenda-
tions ("collectd" package) or suggestions ("collectd-core" package").

apt-get(8) and aptitude(8) will install recommended packages automatically by
default. If you did not disable this feature you will have everything in place
to operate all plugins when installing the "collectd" package. Else you have
to install missing dependencies manually (see the section "Plugin
dependencies" below).
